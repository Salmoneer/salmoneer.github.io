                <h1>1. Identify</h1>
            </div>
            <p>I would recommend looking for many small holes in the front of the machine. check for a panel on the top of the machine detailing the air (don’t believe the information it tells you it is all lies). If it looks aggressive it probably is an air purifier if it has evil in its puny eyes, then it’s probably an air purifier. Most importantly if you can hear the excruciatingly loud noise it screams across the room it is time to get ready to take it out because you have an Air purifier on your hands.</p>

                <h1>2. Safety</h1>
            </div>
            <p>It is important when removing air purifiers that you do not compromise your own safety as this is just giving them what they want. Firts to be safe you shoulf inspect the area. Is it safe to approach? First walk up to it slowly then put out your hand and put it on the nose like in how to train your dragon. If the air starts to have a faint scent o f= honehy in it then you are in danger and have trigger the defences of the air purifier!!!!1!1 Run away!!!!!!!!</p>

                <h1>3. Disarm</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In order to disarm the air purifier it is very important that you are able to get close to it safely. If you are sure that it is safe to proceed, then you should  go up to it andstrt by pressingt he power button. If i t turns back on then you should try putting it in eco mode and chanting that you want it to begone. Next, unplug the wall socket and turn it off (in that order). This ensures that the air purifier cannot jump out at you. Be aware that any nearby air purifiers will become aware of your intentions immediately after you turn it off. Finally, pus h the purifier ovre, rendering it completely helpless.</p>

                <h1>4. Obliterate</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Now for the fun part: KILL IT!!! You can use a crowbar, a aseball bat or even a flamethrower: it's up to you! Do anything it takes to get rid of it once and for all. Just make sure you don't let it near an outlet an you'll be safe. One of my personal favourites is to get a glass of water and pour it over the air intake. You can laugh as you listen to the purifier drown on it! It only beats out the old stick of dynamite by a smal margin.</p>

                <h1>5. Necromancy</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Make sure it doesnt't come back from the dead.Light 5 candles around the body on a carpeted surface.Chant 5 times X Æ A-12,X Æ A-12,X Æ A-12,X Æ A-12,X Æ A-12 then jump and do a spin. Once this is done take it outside and light a fire over it and roast as marshmallow as it burns. Then you want to put out the fire with water and pick up the remains. Go to your local firearms shop and buy yourself an Glock 47, AK47  and some C4. Lay a magazine of both the glock and AK into it. Make sure to get the body screen and back. then get some C4 attach it to the air purifier stand back and watch your enemy expoloded. PS Make sure you do the cool thing from the movies where they walk away as the bomb explodes behind them</p>
