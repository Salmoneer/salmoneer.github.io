            <h1>Air Purifiers</h1>
            <p>You may have noticed in recent times the number of air purifiers around, classrooms, libraries, offices, parks, kindergartens, arcades, movie theatres, and shops. So how come all of these have been popping up everywhere? These guys are up to no good, speared headed by Samsung Electronics co, LTD, and funded by our own government, all of a sudden, these so-called life-saving machines are running rampant. It is obvious of their malivious intent, they make noise and have their own networks (could be spys). We need to get rid of these things before they get rid of us. During covid was the perfect opportunitie for the air purifiers to get deployed, the big guys at Samsung with money in their eyes designed these things from top to bottom to steal our information, they sat on their big comfy office chairs with padded seats and decided to spy on everysingle one of us. Why you may be asking yourself?, it so that Samsung can control the whole world with brain microchips, sooner than you thin k samsunt pty co ltd are going to unleash a killer gass into the air though these spy air purilars and they are going to knock us all out. And then the Samsung people in suits will put microchips in our brains with the help of Elon reeve musk he is in on it to making these nano micro bot chips. So the main people are Samsung, elon and the government right? Wrong KONG pet toys are big players in this whole evil plan to take over the world. The Kong pet toy technology is home in the Samsung air purifier. If you canâ€™t see these evil tactics that are being used then you should open your eyes and see the truth behind the booth.</p>
